PGObject::Util::PGConfig - Postgres Configuration Management

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.10.2

=cut

our $VERSION = 0.010002;


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PGObject::Util::PGConfig;

    my $config = PGObject::Util::PGConfig->new();
    # setting values in the internal store
    $config->set('statement_timeout', 3600); # set the desired state
    $config->set('datestyle', 'ISO');

    # session configuration management
    $config->list($dbh);
    $config->fetch($dbh, 'statement_timeout'); # get the session statement timeout
    # We can now sync with Pg for the dbh session
    $config->sync_session($dbh, qw(statement_timeout datestyle));

    # or we can get from a file
    $config->fromfile('path/to/file');
    # or from file contents
    $config->fromcontents($string);
    # and can return current state as file contents
    $config->filecontents();
    # or write to a file
    $config->tofile('path/to/new.conf');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The current config module provides an abstraction around the PostgreSQL GUC
(configuration system).  This includes parsing config files (postgresql.conf,
recovery.conf) and retrieve current settings from a database configuration.

The module does not depend on a database configuration so it can be used to 
aggregate configuration data from different sources.

Session update guarantees that only appropriate session variables are
updated.

=head1 Methods

=head2 Constructor

=head3 new

The constructor takes no arguments and initializes an empty store.  The store
is implemented as a hashref similar to what you would expect from a Moo/Moose
object but it is recommended that you do not inspect directly because this
behavior is not guaranteed for subclasses.

If a subclass overwrites the storage approach, it MUST override this method
as well.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($pkg) = @_;
    my $self = {};
    bless $self, $pkg;
}

=head2 Internal store

There are several things which are not the responsibility of the internal
store.  These include checking validity of variable names as these could
vary between major versions of PostgreSQL.  Subclasses MAY override these
methods safely and provide a different storage mechanism.

=head3 set($key, $value)

Sets a current GUC variable to a particular value.

=cut

sub set {
    my ($self, $key, $value) = @_;
    croak 'References unsupported' if ref $value;
    $self->{$key} = $value;
}

=head3 forget($key)

Deletes a key from the store

=cut

sub forget {
    my ($self, $key) = @_;
    delete $self->{$key};
}

=head3 known_keys()

Returns a list of keys from the store.

=cut

sub known_keys {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return keys %$self;
}

=head3 get_value($key)

Returns a value from the key in the store.

=cut

sub get_value {
    my ($self, $key) = @_;
    return $self->{$key};
}

=head2 DB Session

The methods in this session integrate with a database session and pull
data from these.  The module itself does not depend on the database
session for general use.

=head3 fetch($dbh, $key)

Retrieves a setting from the session and saves it to the store.

Returns the stored value.

=cut

sub fetch {
    my ($self, $dbh, $key) = @_;
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT current_setting(?)");
    $sth->execute($key);
    $self->set($key, $sth->fetchrow_array);
    return $self->get_value($key); 
}

=head3 list($dbh)

Returns a list of all GUC variables set for the database session at $dbh

Does not affect store.

=cut

sub list {
    my ($self, $dbh) = @_;
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT name FROM pg_settings ORDER BY name');
    $sth->execute;
    my @keys;
    while (my ($key) = $sth->fetchrow_array){
       push @keys, $key;
    }
    return @keys;
}

=head3 sync_session($dbh)

Synchronizes all stored variables into the current session if applicable.

=cut

sub sync_session{
    my ($self, $dbh) = @_;
    my $query = "
       SELECT s.name FROM pg_settings s
         JOIN pg_roles r ON rolname = session_user
        WHERE name = any(?) 
              AND (s.context = 'user'
                    OR s.context = 'superuser' AND r.rolsuper)
    ";
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare($query);
    $sth->execute([$self->known_keys]);
    my $setsth = $dbh->prepare(
       "SELECT set_config(?, ?, false)");
    while (my ($setname) = $sth->fetchrow_array){
       $setsth->execute($setname, $self->get_value($setname));
    }
}

=head2 apply_system($dbh)

Requires superuser access.  Runs ALTER SYSTEM commands for all appropriate
keys.

=cut

sub apply_system {
    my ($self, $dbh) = @_;
    croak 'Need a database handle' unless ref $dbh;
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare('
          select rolsuper from pg_roles where rolname = session_user
    ');
    $sth->execute();
    if (! ($sth->fetchrow_array)[0]){
        croak 'DB connection for apply_system must be for a superuser';
    }
    my $setting_sth = $dbh->prepare("
      select name from setting where name = any(?)
      and context <> 'internal'
    ");
    $setting_sth->execute([$self->known_keys]);
    my @settings;
    while (my ($setting) = $setting_sth->fetchrow_array){
       push @settings, $setting;
    }
    $setting_sth->finish;
    for (@settings){
        my $key = $dbh->quote_identifier($_);
        my $value = $dbh->quote($self->get_value($_));
        $dbh->do("ALTER SYSTEM SET $key TO $value");
    } 
    return @settings;
    
}

=head2 File and Contents

This module is also capable of reading to and writing to files
and generating file content in the format expected.  This means that the
general whitespace rules and escaping approach PostgreSQL expects are met.

=head3 fromfile($path)

Reads the contents from a file. Loads the whole file into memory.

=cut

sub fromfile {
    my ($self, $file) = @_;
    my $fh;
    open $fh, '<', $file;
    $self->fromcontents(join("", <$fh>));
    close $fh;
}

=head3 fromcontents($contents)

Parses file content and sets the internal store accordingly.

=cut

sub _unescape {
    my ($val) = @_;
    return unless defined $val;
    $val =~ s/''/'/g;
    $val =~ s/(^'|'$)//g;
    return $val;
}

sub _escape {
    my ($val) = @_;
    $val =~ s/'/''/g;
    return $val;
}

sub fromcontents {
    my ($self, $contents) = @_;
    for my $line (split(/(\r|\n)/, $contents)){
        $line =~ s/\#.*//;
        $line =~ s/(^\s*|\s*$)//g;
        next unless $line;

        my ($key, $value);
        if ($line =~ /=/){
            ($key, $value) = split(/\s*=\s*/, $line, 2);
        } else {
            ($key, $value) = split(/\s/, $line, 2);
        }
 
        $self->set($key, _unescape($value));
    }
}

=head3 filecontents()

Returns file contents.  Variables are set in alphabetical order

=cut

sub filecontents{
    my ($self) = @_;
    return join "\n",
           (map {"$_ = '" . _escape($self->get_value($_)) . "'" }
           sort $self->known_keys);
}

=head3 tofile($path)

Writes the contents, per filecontents above, to $path

=cut

sub tofile {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;
    my $fh;
    open $fh, '>', $path;
    print $fh $self->filecontents;
    close $fh;
}

=head2 Future Versions

=head3 sync_system($dbh)

This command will use ALTER SYSTEM statements to set defaults to be used on 
next PostgreSQL restart or reload.  Not yet supported.
